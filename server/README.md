# Python server

Main technologies used are [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and 
[SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/20/)

Recommended way of running the server is through the docker compose one folder up from here.

However if you have the necessary databases up locally you can run src/main.py. Just remember to update the
connection strings for the databases.
